# Bestie list protocol (`bestie-list`)

Bestie reminders and to-dos live in the Bestie DM RHS (localStorage, scoped by
relay / owner / agent). Mutations happen three ways:

1. **RHS UI** — category slide `+` (reminders include a due datetime picker).
2. **Natural language** — user messages like `Remind me to … in 20 minutes` or
   `Add a todo: …` are applied client-side (and a short turn hint is appended so
   the agent can acknowledge with a fence).
3. **Agent fence** — Bestie agent replies may include:

```bestie-list
{"op":"add","items":[{"kind":"reminder","text":"Call mom","dueAt":1735689600}]}
```

`dueAt` is unix seconds (ISO-8601 strings also accepted). Ops: `add`,
`complete`, `remove`.

Due reminders are detected by the ~5 minute wake loop (plus a one-shot timer for
the next dueAt). A due nudge shows the footer `!` badge, auto-opens the Bestie
popover, and renders the amber check-in banner (not a normal DM).

Client dedupe: open items with the same kind and normalized text are not
added twice when due times match within 120s, or when the first item was
created in the last 10 minutes (covers NL + agent fence on one ask).
