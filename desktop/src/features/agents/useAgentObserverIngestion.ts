 * subscription starts and their frames decrypt into `knownAgentPubkeys`.
 *
 * Community bots (OpenClaw / buzz-acp@korg etc.) publish kind 24200 frames

/**
 * App-level owner-global observer ingestion.
 *
 * Mounted once in AppShell so observer frames (kind 24200) are received,
 * decrypted, and folded into the derived active-turns store regardless of
 * which screen or panel happens to be open. Individual surfaces read from the
 * stores; none of them need to mount their own bridge for ingestion to work.
 *
 * This is the product invariant: if the current identity owns an agent (local
 * managed agent or declared-owned relay agent) — or has installed a community
 * bot that telemeters to this owner — its turn activity is ingested app-wide,
 * not only while a panel that happens to mount a bridge is open.
 *
 * Mounts before identity resolves by design: while `currentPubkey` is still
 * `undefined`, `combineObserverIngestionAgents` returns managed agents only,
 * and relay-owned / community agents are folded in on the render after identity
 * arrives. Do not gate this hook on identity/startup readiness — that would
 * drop managed-agent observer coverage during startup.
